- [x] Inbox - shows the user information about their posts and responses. If the user doesn't have posts that have been responded to, nothing will show up in that section, but the code in the inbox page will show this functionality
- [x] Response to Question page - when a user clicks a question on the home page they are brought to page where they can submit a response
- [x] Plan and implementation of final appearance - pages are styled wusing CSS
- [x] Formatting home page - home page shows posts from the database
- [x] Correcting page - when a user recieves a response to prompt they posted, they can correct the response and send it back to the user. This is not fully connected yet but can be seen by typing "/correction/1" into the url.
- [x] Completed post page in inbox - this is an extension of the user's inbox which shows the posts they have responded to. This section exits but users my not work if a user doesn't have posts or response. The framework of it can be seen on the site and in the code for the inbox page.
