## Sprint 2

### Main Goals
 - [x] User Login Flow - The user is sent to a login screen when if they are no logged in. The site uses firebase authenticiation.
 - [ ] Profile Page requests data from database - We were not able to complete this because the authentication wasn't working until very recently. This should not be too difficult to accomplish in sprint 3
 - [x] Home page loads in sample posts from database - once logged in, the posts shown are sample posts from the database
 - [x] Filter sorts posts on the home page - filter is on the left of the homepage
 - [ ] User can make a post - this was not completed because authentication took longer than expected
 - [x] Inbox - click the inbox button in the nav bar to get to this page


### Secondary Goals
 - [ ] Plan for the appearance of the final website - we were still changing around so many elements that it didn't make snes eto get tied to an appearence at this stage of production.
